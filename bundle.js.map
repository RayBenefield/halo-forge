Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.

Each player can make their character walk forward. The aim is to be first over the finishing line to score. Each player has 1 bullet, so they can kill one other player. However they don't necessarily know out of all of the characters on the screen which one is an actual player, and which is some random NPC. I should note that the NPCs also randomly walk forward. (Watch a little bit of the video above and it'll make more sense, you'll notice there are only 3 players, but approx 20 characters in total moving across the screen randomly.)\\n\\nSo the player needs to be somewhat conservative with making their way towards the finish line, they don't want to make it too obvious that they're a human-player, but they also don't want to be left behind / not-first.\\n\\nBy limiting each player to 1 bullet, generally should result in players being cautious about wasting their shot and leaving it to the last moment possible, i.e. when a character is just about to cross the finish line.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo I had some ideas already for how this could work in forge.\\n\\nHave a large wall with 20~ pigs on it. These pigs represent the players and the random NPCs.\\n\\nEach player is inside their own box from which they have 2 area-triggers. Walk and run. So for example they walk onto the green square and their pig begins to move. They walk onto the blue square and the pig moves even faster. (Note in the original game, NPCs can't run, so if you see a character running you immediately know they're a player.)\\n\\nFrom within their own box, each player has a clear view of the pig-wall.\\n\\nPlayers would be armed with a Spartan Laser with only 1 shot remaining. The Splaser's red targeting laser would somewhat replicate the cross-hair tension present in the original game.\\n\\nScoring could work by having the other players die, so the last-man standing scores a point. If you blow up a pig, the corresponding player's box is blown up, killing them. If you're the first pig over the finish line, everyone else's box is blown up except the winner. If an npc is first over the line, every player's box is blown up, resulting in no winner + shame.\\n\\nThe main difficulties I would foresee involve the NPC pigs. Their movement needs to be random to allow players to try and emulate their random movement. You also would need to randomise which pigs are controlled by players, and which ones are NPC.\\nI don't have a lot of knowledge on H5's forge, but a quick googling brought up a forum post were somebody suggested using a ball rolling and hitting one of several triggers to 'randomly' select a script. Or something like that. Anyway, I can go into greater detail about some of the ideas I had about how this could all be pulled off if anybody is interested in giving it a shot.

So I figured I'd share it here in case somebody else wanted to have a crack at it:\\n\\nFor context, here's the mini-game Death Race from Hidden in Plain Sight. If you watch for the first minute or so you should get a rough idea about how the game works.\\nhttps://youtu.be/kdGHotkye_E?t=17\\n\\nRough explanation: There are a bunch of characters on the left side screen with a finishing line on the right. Each player can make their character walk forward. The aim is to be first over the finishing line to score. Each player has 1 bullet, so they can kill one other player. However they don't necessarily know out of all of the characters on the screen which one is an actual player, and which is some random NPC. I should note that the NPCs also randomly walk forward. (Watch a little bit of the video above and it'll make more sense, you'll notice there are only 3 players, but approx 20 characters in total moving across the screen randomly.)\\n\\nSo the player needs to be somewhat conservative with making their way towards the finish line, they don't want to make it too obvious that they're a human-player, but they also don't want to be left behind / not-first.\\n\\nBy limiting each player to 1 bullet, generally should result in players being cautious about wasting their shot and leaving it to the last moment possible, i.e. when a character is just about to cross the finish line.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo I had some ideas already for how this could work in forge.\\n\\nHave a large wall with 20~ pigs on it. These pigs represent the players and the random NPCs.\\n\\nEach player is inside their own box from which they have 2 area-triggers. Walk and run. So for example they walk onto the green square and their pig begins to move. They walk onto the blue square and the pig moves even faster. (Note in the original game, NPCs can't run, so if you see a character running you immediately know they're a player.)\\n\\nFrom within their own box, each player has a clear view of the pig-wall.\\n\\nPlayers would be armed with a Spartan Laser with only 1 shot remaining. The Splaser's red targeting laser would somewhat replicate the cross-hair tension present in the original game.\\n\\nScoring could work by having the other players die, so the last-man standing scores a point. If you blow up a pig, the corresponding player's box is blown up, killing them. If you're the first pig over the finish line, everyone else's box is blown up except the winner. If an npc is first over the line, every player's box is blown up, resulting in no winner + shame.\\n\\nThe main difficulties I would foresee involve the NPC pigs. Their movement needs to be random to allow players to try and emulate their random movement. You also would need to randomise which pigs are controlled by players, and which ones are NPC.\\nI don't have a lot of knowledge on H5's forge, but a quick googling brought up a forum post were somebody suggested using a ball rolling and hitting one of several triggers to 'randomly' select a script. Or something like that. Anyway, I can go into greater detail about some of the ideas I had about how this could all be pulled off if anybody is interested in giving it a shot. I'm fairly confident it can be pulled off, and I'm also confident it'd be a really fun mini-game.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf at this stage you're still uncertain about how this game works / why it would be fun there are a few other youtube videos out there like : https://youtu.be/Jp9yRFaFX8M?t=29\\n\\nI can speak from personal experience that when I was in a video games club at uni this game was incredibly popular and a regular at our events.\\n\\nThanks!\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"selftext_html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there folks, I had an idea for a mini-game that I think would work quite well in H5 but unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t have the time or forge-skills to bring it to life.

If you watch for the first minute or so you should get a rough idea about how the game works.\\n&lt;a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/kdGHotkye_E?t=17\\\"&gt;https://youtu.be/kdGHotkye_E?t=17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rough explanation: There are a bunch of characters on the left side screen with a finishing line on the right. Each player can make their character walk forward. The aim is to be first over the finishing line to score. Each player has 1 bullet, so they can kill one other player. However they don&amp;#39;t necessarily know out of all of the characters on the screen which one is an actual player, and which is some random NPC. I should note that the NPCs also randomly walk forward. (Watch a little bit of the video above and it&amp;#39;ll make more sense, you&amp;#39;ll notice there are only 3 players, but approx 20 characters in total moving across the screen randomly.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So the player needs to be somewhat conservative with making their way towards the finish line, they don&amp;#39;t want to make it too obvious that they&amp;#39;re a human-player, but they also don&amp;#39;t want to be left behind / not-first.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;By limiting each player to 1 bullet, generally should result in players being cautious about wasting their shot and leaving it to the last moment possible, i.e. when a character is just about to cross the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I had some ideas already for how this could work in forge.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Have a large wall with 20~ pigs on it. These pigs represent the players and the random NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Each player is inside their own box from which they have 2 area-triggers. Walk and run. So for example they walk onto the green square and their pig begins to move. They walk onto the blue square and the pig moves even faster. (Note in the original game, NPCs can&amp;#39;t run, so if you see a character running you immediately know they&amp;#39;re a player.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From within their own box, each player has a clear view of the pig-wall.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Players would be armed with a Spartan Laser with only 1 shot remaining. The Splaser&amp;#39;s red targeting laser would somewhat replicate the cross-hair tension present in the original game.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Scoring could work by having the other players die, so the last-man standing scores a point. If you blow up a pig, the corresponding player&amp;#39;s box is blown up, killing them. If you&amp;#39;re the first pig over the finish line, everyone else&amp;#39;s box is blown up except the winner. If an npc is first over the line, every player&amp;#39;s box is blown up, resulting in no winner + shame.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The main difficulties I would foresee involve the NPC pigs. Their movement needs to be random to allow players to try and emulate their random movement. You also would need to randomise which pigs are controlled by players, and which ones are NPC.\\nI don&amp;#39;t have a lot of knowledge on H5&amp;#39;s forge, but a quick googling brought up a forum post were somebody suggested using a ball rolling and hitting one of several triggers to &amp;#39;randomly&amp;#39; select a script. Or something like that. Anyway, I can go into greater detail about some of the ideas I had about how this could all be pulled off if anybody is interested in giving it a shot. I&amp;#39;m fairly confident it can be pulled off, and I&amp;#39;m also confident it&amp;#39;d be a really fun mini-game.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If at this stage you&amp;#39;re still uncertain about how this game works / why it would be fun there are a few other youtube videos out there like : &lt;a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/Jp9yRFaFX8M?t=29\\\"&gt;https://youtu.be/Jp9yRFaFX8M?t=29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can speak from personal experience that when I was in a video games club at uni this game was incredibly popular and a regular at our events.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"spoiler\": false,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"stickied\": false,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"subreddit\": \"forge\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qmpd\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"suggested_sort\": null,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"thumbnail\": \"self\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"[IDEA] Mini game -

For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\n  (0, _inherits3.default)(BeforeAfterWrapper, _Component);\n\n  function BeforeAfterWrapper() {\n    (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, BeforeAfterWrapper);\n    return (0, _possibleConstructorReturn3.default)(this, (BeforeAfterWrapper.__proto__ || (0, _getPrototypeOf2.default)(BeforeAfterWrapper)).apply(this, arguments));\n  }\n\n  (0, _createClass3.default)(BeforeAfterWrapper, [{\n    key: 'render',\n    value: function render() {\n      var _props = this.props,\n          beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle,\n          afterStyle = _props.afterStyle,\n          beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType,\n          afterElementType = _props.afterElementType,\n          elementType = _props.elementType,\n          other = (0, _objectWithoutProperties3.default)(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n      var prepareStyles = this.context.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n      var beforeElement = void 0;\n      var afterElement = void 0;\n\n      if (beforeStyle) {\n        beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n          key: '::before'\n        });\n      }\n\n      if (afterStyle) {\n        afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n          key: '::after'\n        });\n      }\n\n      var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n      var props = other;\n      props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n      return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n    }\n  }]);\n  return BeforeAfterWrapper;\n}(_react.Component);\n\nBeforeAfterWrapper.defaultProps = {\n  beforeElementType: 'div',\n  afterElementType: 'div',\n  elementType: 'div'\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.contextTypes = {\n  muiTheme: _react.PropTypes.object.isRequired\n};\nprocess.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\" ?
